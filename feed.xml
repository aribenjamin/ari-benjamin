As this hypothesis is beginning to be tested empirically, I thought I’d write about one source of tension in particular – the question of <strong>Why?</strong> Why would we evolve this way? What benefit could it possibly confer? If we answer this, perhaps embodied emotion may not appear so alien to mainstream science.</p> <hr/> <p>Take a moment to feel the lingering tension in your feet, your hands, or your neck. Stressed at work? You’ll feel it in your body, as tense knots in your back, neck, or jaw. Try relaxing your forehead. From introspection alone it is impossible to deny that we carry emotions in our body<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p> <p>It is likewise difficult to deny that the state of our bodies also affects our emotional state. Think back to the last time you took a hot bath. On entering the water your muscles relaxed, and also <em>you</em> relaxed. The arrow of causality runs in both directions: mind -&gt; musculature and musculature -&gt; mind. At the least one must recogognize that your body is “in the loop” of your emotional state.</p> <p>This bidirectionality of emotion, mind, and body is no new news. Around the world there are dozens of healing traditions premised on the idea that our bodies affect our emotions. The meridian system underlying acupuncture and Shiatsu massage is one notable example. It is also a common observation in certain areas of psychology, too. Today, you can find it in titles like <em>The Body Keeps the Score</em> and in theraputic practices under the umbrella of “somatic” practices.</p> <p>In the psychology of emotions, this idea goes back at least to William James. In his classic 1884 paper “What is an Emotion?” James asserts that “we feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble.” To support this idea, he first points to the many autonomous bodily changes that accompany emotions.</p> <blockquote> <p>Hardly a senation comes to us without sending waves of alternate constriction and dilation down the arteries of our arms. … The bladder and bowels, the glands of the mousth, throad, and skin, and the liver, are known to be affected gravely in certain severe emotions, and are unquestionably affected transiently when the emotions are of a lighter sort… no shade of emotion, however slight, should be without a bodily reverberation as unique, when taken in its total conplexity, as is the mental mood itself.</p> </blockquote> <p>James then goes further to posit that these bodily changes are not just correlated with emotions, but are the emotions themselves. This hypothesis is now known as the James-Lange theory of emotion. As evidence, James presents two arguments. First, he introspectively finds it difficult to imagine an emotion without its bodily accompaniment. Second, he wonders about the neurological seat of such emotions. “Either separate and special centres, affected to them alone, are their brain-seat, or else they correspond to the processes occuring in the motor and sensory centres.” In other words, emotions are either a separate thing in the brain, or they are the same thing as the motor and sensory processes that accompany them. (We now know that neither is strictly true; this is an “either-or” fallacy.)</p> <p>Today, the James-Lange theory forms the basis of the theory of <em>constructed emotion</em>. To say emotions are ‘constructed’ means emotions are <em>perceptions</em> of our bodies’s visceral reactions<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This means that they are influenced by the all the same category biases, cultural relativism, and linguistic associations as the rest of our perceptual decisions. Emotions are conceptual categorizations of that visceral stimulus. Emotional categories are perceptual concepts. This explains why motions are not the same across all cultures; for just about every emotion that is felt as a “universal emotion” in the US, there is at least one culture for which that is not a basic emotional category. For a nice intro to this perspective, I recommend this phenomenal podcast episode by Invisibilia<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p> <h4 id="which-causes-which-is-the-wrong-question">‘Which causes which’ is the wrong question</h4> <p>While I find the James-Lange theory a compelling antidote to the naive notion of emotions as purely mental phenomena, it’s proponents and detractors alike often get caught up in the question of ‘which causes which’. Does the body cause the emotion, or does the emotion cause the body?</p> <p>This is the wrong question. The body and the mind are not separate entities. The body is ‘in the loop’ of the mind (and I might add the brain is ‘in the loop’ of the body.) This is to say that the dynamics of activity in the brain are strongly affected by sensory streams from the body, all of which are affected by the brain’s output. It is a feedback loop; a dynamical system in which neither part is the strict cause of the other.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there is one question that neither the James-Lange theory nor an agnostic feedback loop perspective offers a satisfactory answer to: <strong>Why?</strong> Why would we evolve this way? What benefit could it possibly confer? If we answer this, perhaps embodied emotion may not appear so alien to mainstream science.</p> <h4 id="why-is-emotional-information-in-the-body-in-the-first-place">Why is emotional information in the body in the first place?</h4> <p>Why would our nervous systems endow our musculature with emotional information, only to then read-out emotions from that same musculature? What business does it have doing there?</p> <p>The obvious response might be that it is doing some useful work; moving, for example, or dilating the arteries for action. Yet on closer inspection, much of this bodily response does not appear to be doing anything at all. Consider again the anxious muscle tension in your upper back. For the purposes of moving about in the world and changing things – affecting things – one’s anxious muscle tension is useless. If you open a textbook on the neural control of movement, you will read that our motor neurons exist to move our bodies. (Indeed, the name of the field is “motor control” rather than the more agnostic “muscle control”.) It falls outside of the paradigm of motor control that our brains should be instructing our muscles to hold muscle tension for no physical purpose.</p> <p>Sustained muscle tension is not just unhelpful, but also wasteful. It restricts our available movement. Muscles are expensive, metabolically speaking <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Even in sleep and in deep depression, one’s muscles are never fully relaxed. Elsewhere in biology it’s bizarre to observe such a waste of energy. In fact, the idea of efficiency is usually a powerful explanatory tool. If you go so far to assume as a first principle that we evolved to act and perceive with a minimum amount of energy, it turns out to predict biology in a lot of ways. For example, the idea of efficient coding in perception <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. One can get so much mileage out of efficiency, explain so many phenomena, that in certain fields of neuroscience it’s a keystone concept. And yet, here we are, holding emotion in our bodies all day long throughout our entire lives.</p> <h4 id="so-why-might-this-be-the-case">So why might this be the case?</h4> <p>Now, it’s certainly possible that holding emotion in the body serves no purpose. Perhaps this wasted energy is just a suboptimality. A bad accident, an evolutionary bystander for intelligence: maybe we didn’t evolve to be so anxious. Or maybe you’re just, you know, bad at being a human. I don’t buy this at all. We’re talking about subconscious motor control and emotion – evolutionary dinosaurs. (Of course we evolved to be anxious, silly.) These systems have had a while to evolve to be less extravagantly wasteful of ATP. This dismissal smells to me like the refusal to admit or consider facts that can’t be explained by the paradigm of efficiency in motor control. If it doesn’t make sense, simply call it noise or suboptimal and move on.</p> <p>I find it more likely that it does serve an adaptive purpose. That we are better for being this way. Let’s at least entertain this possibility. If it serves a purpose, it is a solution to some problem. <strong>What problem is embodied emotion a solution to?</strong></p> <p>In this post I want to speculate that the role that the physical body can play with ‘unnecessary’ muscle tension is storing information about one’s state and situation.</p> <h4 id="perhaps-storing-state-information-isnt-as-easy-as-it-sounds">Perhaps storing state information isn’t as easy as it sounds.</h4> <p>Emotions are modulators of our decisions and actions. If one were to write a computational description of emotion <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, they are state variables that shift our behavior and our responses to the world. Anger, jealousy, sadness, excitement: one acts differently in each of these states. Emotions allow organisms to respond differently to same stimuli depending on its recent history and goals.</p> <p>These state modulators need to be stored in the body for a considerable period of time: hours, or days. Perhaps – just maybe – the body and muscles provide an efficient and easy mechanism for the storage of information over these time periods.</p> <p>If this is true, the embodiment of one’s emotional state may serve the purpose of storage. Your body becomes a memory bank for information. More radically, your body’s state <em>is</em> that emotional state. This explains why our emotions are present in our bodies, and why our emotions act like perceptions of our bodies.</p> <hr/> <p>To bolster my idea that this is actually useful, I should describe why the other mechanisms of that the body has for remembering state may not be sufficient. According to the standard picture, these mechansisms are <strong>neuromodulators</strong> and <strong>persistent neural activity</strong>.</p> <p>First, neuromodulators. These things are great. You’ve got cortisol for e.g. stress and exercise, plus oxytocin, vasopressin, prolactin, bombesin, dynorphin, etc. A standard picture is that the space of neuromodulators can encode all the emotions or behavioral states that we require. (Usually, this picture adopts the ‘basic emotion category’ framework, which posits universal emotions, rather than the ‘constructed emotion category’ framework, in which emotions are culturally specific.)</p> <p>The problem I see with this picture alone is that a neuromodulatory system is extremely complex and difficult to evolve. Between receptors and signaling cascades, a new neuromodulatory system requires dozens of proteins to work. It seems to me it would be pretty difficult to evolve a new neuromodulator. This may explain why the majority of confirmed neuromodulators convey information about ancient needs: thirst, hunger, mating, dominance, pain, maternal instinct.</p> <p>As our social lives got more complicated in recent evolutionary history, our emotional lives needed to keep up in complexity. Since neuromodulatory systems take a while to develop, animals may have developed alternative systems of keeping track of state information and using it to modulate behavior. These systems likely repurposed the hardware that we already have.</p> <p>Secondly, there is persistent activity. While it is difficult to know what is possible in the brain, we can at least create simple simulations in the form of artificial neural networks. In these simulations, is appears to be the case that neural networks are really bad at storing information in persistent activity over long timescales. If we trust neural network modelling, an hours- or days-long state had better be stored somewhere else. (It’s always possible that the modellers just haven’t figured this out yet, though. Perhaps there are specialized structures designed specifically to store long-term emotional states in persistent activity.)</p> <p>It’s also true that short-term plasticity could play this role. There may be plasticity mechanisms that persist for hours which encode an animal’s recent state. This is certainly quite possible, and I don’t have any good reason that evolutionary recent, culturally-specific modulatory states couldn’t be stored in this way.</p> <p>So, yes, there are other ways we have of storing medium-term state information. What I will say is that these are unlikely to be solely the domain of neuromodulators, and that some system that is easy to repurpose might adopt this secondary role. The body is (one) good candidate for this, in that the timescale of information flow is slower than the fast dynamics of neural activity alone. It wouldn’t be the first time in which we’ve observed animals using their bodies for computational purposes beyond direct movement. For example, when training rats to press buttons with difficult time intervals, they tend to invent meandering movements that involve hitting the buttons at the right time<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. They “use their bodies as clocks”.</p> <h3 id="our-bodies-as-memory-banks-for-behavioral-state">Our bodies as memory banks for behavioral state</h3> <p>In summary, I’m proposing that the body is an information storage bank for particular behavioral states. When an animal decides to enter a new state, that information is held in persistent loops of muscle tension. One’s state is read out from one’s musculature, or changed by affecting one’s musculature.</p> <p>Broadly, this fits comfortably within the embodied cognition viewpoint. Our bodies serve a purpose beyond affecting the physical world. They assist our computations, as well. They are part and parcel of our cognitive machinery. Here, I’m proposing this machinery resembles a memory bank.</p> <p>Now, this is starting to feel a little “out there,” but I don’t think I’m saying much that’s new here. It’s pretty uncontroversial that your body is in the loop of your emotions. (Go get a massage, if you don’t believe me.) All I’ve added is a normative interpretation: a computational reason why this is useful.</p> <p>What do you think? Ping me with thoughts, references, or potential experiments <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p> <hr/> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Before you think I’m getting all dualist, I want to stress that by “body” I mean the way the body interacts with the nervous system.

If I were making a citation list I’d probably start with William James’s “What is an Emotion?” and James Averill’s “A constructivist view of emotion”. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>See https://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/530718193/emotions <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:8"> <p>It’s slightly more complicated. Muscles are expensive to <em>use</em>, but it’s not so expensive to <em>hold</em> them in a state of tension. Myosin actually uses ATP to release from actin; to relax. So this might be a decent information storage system that doesn’t cost too much energy. <a href="#fnref:8" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:4"> <p>Too many citations are possible here. One would have to start with Horace Barlow’s body of work and legacy. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:5"> <p>For example, Bach, Dominik R., and Peter Dayan. “Algorithms for survival: a comparative perspective on emotions.” Nature Reviews Neuroscience 18, no. 5 (2017): 311-319. I have reservations about the physicalist perspective inherent in this blog post, and in the idea that emotions are best understood as algorithms. It seems to flatten so much of the inherently human. But for the purposes of providing an evolutionary, normative argument, neuroscience has gotten far by treating our inner world as informaton processing. I’m certainly not going to be able to provide a workable alternative in this blog post. <a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:6"> <p>See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315002202 <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:7"> <p>Here’s an interesting experiment that could add weight to this perspective. Using widespread EMG, observe what patterns of muscle activations correspond to an expected emotional state (in the case of animals) or a reported emotion (in the case of humans). (Both have drawbacks: you don’t know what animals are feeling; humans aren’t very good at telling you either.) Then, do the same in a different context and emotion. You should observe different patterns. Next, <em>stimulate</em> muscle activation in one of the two patterns. You should observe a difference in evoked behavior, consistent with an emotion, (in the case of an animal), or the human subject will report feeling that emotion. The use of two observed emotions serves as a control that the stimulation itself doesn’t cause the emotion. I think this experiment would be good evidence for constructed emotion. But, of course, it doesn’t say <em>why</em> this happens. It doesn’t provide evidence for evolutionary pressure. I’m not sure of an experiment that would provide that further evidence. <a href="#fnref:7" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Towards a computational theory of embodied emotion.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Where is wonder in computational neuroscience?</title><link href="https://ari-benjamin.com/blog/2021/wonder/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Where is wonder in computational neuroscience?"/><published>2021-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ari-benjamin.com/blog/2021/wonder</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ari-benjamin.com/blog/2021/wonder/"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re reading this, then I know that you’ve experienced a true sense of wonder at least once in your life. Wonder astonishes. For me, wonder is closest to awe. It accompanies revelations, usually visual, that my own experience and moment in time is astonishingly minute. I’ve experienced this staring at the stars on many occasions; on viewing the Hubble deep field for the first time; on gazing over layers of strata in the American Southwest.</p> <p>I’m not sure humanity would pursue science if no one felt a sense of wonder. Reality— its unimaginability, its intricacy— is wondrous, and this is what draws us to know it as best we can. I t may be difficult to describe wonder’s necessity for science better than, of course, Einstein, who wrote, “The fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious… He who knows it not and can no longer wonder, no longer fell amazement, is a good as dead. A snuffed-out candle.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> </p> <figure><center> <img width="700" src="https://cdn.myportfolio.com/cca5e069-e6b7-4b8c-8eba-40eb2267d261/a5590f4e-b9b8-47dc-a2e6-2c487da7c0a1_rw_1920.jpg?h=943ad28edc8a66fc79f2f08fe6405513" data-action="zoom"/> </center></figure> <p>But what exactly is wonder? When do we feel it? I’m compelled by the idea that wonder is reliably felt when confronted with the true scale of the unknown. Unknowability is key to wonder. Not abject unknowability, the “unknown unknown”, but a known unknowability. We learn, in some new way, that the world is vaster and more marvelous and complex than we had the capacity to imagine.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Once we lose our fear of being tiny, we find ourselves on the threshold of a vast and awesome universe which dwarfs—in time, in space, and in potential—the tidy anthropocentric proscenium of our ancestors” – Carl Sagan <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The requirement of an unknowable vastness—of time, space, or potential— seems at odds with the goals of science. If we seek to understand, and wonder requires unknowability, does understanding diminish wonder? Does science kills wonder by explaining things away?</p> <p>I say no. Wonder first requires discovery. Without science, these vastnesses would remain unseen. Wonder and explanation are best described as in a dance. At times they are in opposition to one another. But they are co-dependent, and give rise to one another.</p> <p>Should scientific disciplines seek to produce wonder? I don’t think many would say “no”, here. To many, including the religious, the feeling that the universe is a marvelous place is what makes life worth living, and if a discipline has the opportunity to instill wonder it should seize it.</p> <p>On the other hand, though, pursuing wonder is at odds with many traditional ways of doing science. Compared to other aims of science, producing wonder stands out by not requiring explanation – or is even at odds with it. </p> <p>Producing wonder is rarely a consequence of modeling and explanation. Consider the Hubble Deep Field or Pale Blue Dot images – these are not explanations of previous phenomena, nor were they themselves the end products of traditional scientific study. They emerged from it, but were not the goals of their sciences. (The Hubble Deep Field was not an approved proposal, for instance, but a use of director’s discretionary time. And what new knowledge was gained from training Voyager’s camera back on Earth?). Yet despite their explanatory emptiness, these provoke wonder and inspired generations of scientists. Only after their creation did these windows on deep space induce curiosity about what they revealed. </p> <p>The dichotomy between wonder and explanation, and yet their mutual requirement, surprised me when I first encountered it. In my discipline, “to explain” is the highest goal. We have normative explanations, evolutionary explanations, computational explanations. Computational neuroscience takes for granted what deserves explaining – animal behavior, for instance. But by focusing so much on explaining everything, what new wonder do we uncover?​​​​​​​</p> <p>What would a computational neuroscience look like that aimed to produce wonder? What are the Pale Blue Dot and Deep Field images of neuroscience?</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p> from The world as I See It (1956), quoted in Krista Tippet, Einstein’s God: Conversations about Science and the Human Spirit (2010) and again in “Like Two Black Holes Colliding”, Explode Every Day: An Inquiry into the Phenomenon of Wonder (2016) <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>Pale Blue Dot (1994), quoted in Rachel Sussman, The Oldest Living Things in the World, quoted again in “Unknown Unknowns”, Explode Every Day: An Inquiry into the Phenomenon of Wonder (2016) <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thoughts on the ideals of science.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hidden perils of a learning pill</title><link href="https://ari-benjamin.com/blog/2021/learning-pill/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hidden perils of a learning pill"/><published>2021-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ari-benjamin.com/blog/2021/learning-pill</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ari-benjamin.com/blog/2021/learning-pill/"><![CDATA[<p>What it means to age, and in part to be human, is to become set in one’s patterns and ways. But what if you could reawaken your ability to learn? Facts and events would suddenly stick in your mind again, the way young children are sponges for information. Imagine learning a second language at 60 as easily as a 5 year old. Perhaps there was a skill you wish you had begun at a younger age — piano, violin, soccer, coding. What would you learn?</p> <p>For a few decades now the field of critical period plasticity has promised this redemptive vision. The promise is medicalized, as is usual: in cases of stroke, surgical removal of brain tissue, or traumatic brain injury, one may very much wish for the ability to re-learn an ability that has been lost. If you’ve lost the ability to speak from a stroke (as in Broca’s aphasia), it can take years of difficult rehab to relearn to communicate your thoughts, and even then complex expressions may entirely evade you. Learning like an infant would seem a godsend. </p> <p>There’s no doubt that a boost to plasticity would be wonderful for people in need. However, I think there are three big reasons to be cautious about this capability, if we ever stumble upon it. Expanded below, these are 1) a potentially unavoidable downside to the technology itself, 2) its potential for societal transformation, and 3) an issue of medical ethics.</p> <p>First, some background. Feel free to skip ahead. </p> <h4 id="critical-periods-for-learning">Critical periods for learning</h4> <font size="4"> The "critical period" refers to a special phase in a developing brain when, put simply, learning is astonishingly fast and effective. If a young brain is damaged in this phase – a minor stroke, for example – the brain quickly repurposes non-damaged tissue for the lost functions. People can live decades before a doctor tells them they must have had a stroke, judging by an unusual brain scan. Individuals blind from birth repurpose their visual cortices for audition, action, and higher cognitive functions. At these young stages, one begins to think that brain tissue is just learning stuff capable of learning anything. (In reality a young brain won't learn "anything", though we still don't have any idea how to predict what sorts of things are in or out of bounds.) The critical period ends at different times for different functions. After about 8 months in humans, if sight is restored in a blind eye the brain will nevertheless not use that eye for vision. This is why critical periods are called critical – it's critical that restorative therapies be delivered in this phase. It's worth mentioning that there's debate about the critical period as a unified concept. The term arose for vision, for which certain things are simply not possible after a certain age. People may be able to learn other things to some degree at any age. Learning slows regardless. I use the term rather informally to refer to the general and striking slowdown in learning rate with age. </font> <h5 id="one-is-silver-and-the-other-gold">One is silver and the other gold</h5> <p>The critical period closes for a reason. A popular theory of why we evolved to slow our rate of learning relates to the so-called stability/plasticity tradeoff. This theory says that memories and abilities can be “overwritten” by new learning, so too much learning is dangerous. If we want to remember the old friends in our memory, we must limit how much new stuff we learn. In this framework, the reason you can’t remember anything from your early years is because you learned so much afterwards.</p> <p>If this story is true, reopening the critical period could be transformative in ways that are hard to predict. Wishing to simply regain one’s sense of speech, one’s memories of early life could fade. New skills could be gained, but old ones lost. In the worst-case scenario, a patient re-entering the womb of critical learning may show severe retrograde amnesia – for either procedural or declarative memory, or both.</p> <p>There is a certain tragedy to this therapy. In Greek mythology, the fountain of Lethe brought total amnesia, and was to be drunk before passing the river into Hades. To forget was to die, but also to live on in a new realm. Reopening the critical period, if it unavoidably requires amnesia, is a Lethean therapy and worth good caution. </p> <p>It is not at all clear that learning “too much” necessarily brings amnesia, however. The stability/plasticity tradeoff is a theory – and even if it’s true in principle, it’s not clear that the brain is up against the limit of how much can be learned. How much capacity for (consolidated) experience and memory does the brain actually have? Maybe we’re far below the limit, and plasticity slows after the critical period for other reasons. Visual tasks could be learned “to completion” as the brain sees it, for example, and evolution had no reason to keep around sensory plasticity mechanisms after that point.</p> <p>It is telling, perhaps, that neuroscience’s friends in deep learning face the same tradeoff. There, researchers know that training artificial neural networks on a second task can completely destroy the ability to perform a previously learned task. This retroactive interference is dramatically termed “catastrophic forgetting”. This relates to the way we train artificial neural networks, though, and not the networks themselves; the capacity of a single network to learn multiple tasks is massive. (Train on both tasks at the same time and the problem goes away). This story may or may not have relevance to neuroscience. What it does tell us is that preventing forgetting is, at the least, a hard engineering problem that AI research hasn’t figured out how to solve. It tells us that maybe, just maybe, the critical period’s brakes on plasticity are serious business.</p> <p>To answer this question, it would be wonderful to know what protects memories in the first place. We certainly don’t forget everything from young childhood. Skills and language grow over time – though you can forget languages if you move to a new country. Keeping memory while artificially increasing plasticity will likely require balancing whatever combination of continued practice and exposure, internal rehearsal, and molecular protections the brain naturally uses to retain memory. Until these questions are answered, it is very possible that a critical period therapy is, unavoidably, a Lethean bargain.</p> <h5 id="a-future-of-lifelong-rebirth">A future of lifelong rebirth</h5> <p>A fascinating thing happens when we imagine what a plasticity therapy would look like even in the best-case scenario: a learning pill with no forgetfulness. As with any technology, it’s crucial we imagine early on what use would like beyond immediate (medical) application. Who would use such a pill? Would applications stick to regain-of-function or begin to stray?</p> <p>In many ways this questions parallels the debate around brain-machine interfaces. Though initially funded as a cure to paralysis or other loss of “normal” bodily functions, already the developers of this technology imagine a world in which we communicate telepathically and transcend the limitations of our body-bound humanity. Sure, this is the hype of Elon Musk, but even the more down-to-earth developers at Facebook (I never thought I’d type that) are developing BMIs primarily for virtual reality control. When BMIs finally mature, I think it’s clear that they’ll be used primarily to gain new functions.</p> <p>What sort of things would people do with a voluntary learning pill? It’s hard to imagine. We’d see languages and professional skills, of course; new skills learned late. But it may also become possible to learn more of one thing than ever before. What sort of specialists will we produce when we unlock the secrets to plasticity? Fearing the worst, we may one day see individuals willing to repurpose massive amounts of their cortex to special functions. Olympic athletes and all those obsessed with greatness may go further than has ever been possible – potentially at the expense of other cognitive skills.</p> <p>We might also see changes to our views of ourselves. What does it mean to be 50 years old? Or 90? We often think of late age as a settled, developed time. It is a “fact of life”, as much as the impressionability of children is a fact of life. Late ages are marked by wisdom, but also by a deep sense of self-definition and identity. Yet if learning could be restored, the themes of the chapters of life may have to be edited. Perhaps these edits may not be more extreme than those of, say, antibiotics and a doubling of lifespan, but that’s saying something. In a society with a cheap plasticity, would 30 be the new 10?</p> <h5 id="a-mind-by-whose-design">A mind by whose design?</h5> <p>Much of the way we structure society today takes for granted the adaptability of the young. Education is an obvious example. Or consider the criminal justice system, which frequently locks people away for decades on the premise that they cannot change and remain a threat to society. In this case, would extensible plasticity be a blessing or a curse?</p> <p>It is not hard to imagine a criminal system that offers, instead of lifetime incarceration, a plasticity therapy. Take some pills, enter a learning program, and one’s behavior and worldview may truly change. Childhood trauma may even fade. This is dicey ethical territory for the reason that no one can anticipate who they will become afterwards. This changes the notion of consent, as arguably one can only consent to things for which the outcome is understood. If offered to the incarcerated as an “alternative”, it’s not really consensual as the alternative is continued punishment. A medical treatment to “criminality” may seem kind, but how is a compulsive shift in personality, memory, and identity respectful of the dignity of a human being?</p> <p>In the final scene of Kubrick’s “One flew over the cuckoo’s nest,” (spoiler ahead! You don’t want this spoiled, I assure you. Go watch it.), the empty, lost gaze of Randle (Jack Nicholson) stares past the camera. It’s one of the most affecting scenes I’ve seen. To compel someone to undergo a lobotomy as a behavioral therapy is deeply unethical. This feels more extreme than a plasticity therapy, yet when you try it’s fairly hard to draw any abstract lines of separation. Both are psychological alterations. Both potentially involve a loss of memory. They are compelled changes of the foundation of someone else’s internal experience.</p> <p>On the other hand, it’s hard to separate this from standard education programs we look positively upon. Think literacy and job training, either in society at large or in the context of criminal justice. (Though there are certainly types of unethical education, like “brainwashing” or programs of cultural erasure and assimilation). Not all “psychological alterations” are unethical. The ethical line lies somewhere between your middle school experience and a lobotomy, and a plasticity therapy lies somewhere in there too.</p> <p>It’s probably premature to talk seriously about the ethics of this. A plasticity therapy could be so many things, with any variety of tradeoffs. Yet I find the ethical questions it brings up fascinating. By what principles should we judge the ethics of changing someone’s mind? What right do we have to our own memories? If only Phillip K. Dick were still around to help us think through it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Or, Don't Reopen that Critical Period!

I thought it was brilliant, both an exercise and as a communicative device.</p> <p>At the same time I was also recreating my CV, as required by my department, and I was feeling disappointed by the linearity and flatness of the format. And so as an exercise in communication and introspection I decided to make my own. But not in pencil – in code.</p> <h2 id="making-colors-represent-topic-similarity">Making colors represent topic similarity</h2> <p>I knew immediately I wanted color to represent the similarity between my academic interests. Without that cue, the 30+ interests of mine would fade into each other.</p> <p>Instead of choosing colors by hand, I felt it would be easier to map the similarity of my interests directly into color algorithmically. This involves three steps:</p> <p>1) Make a similarity matrix for each interest. 2) Use this matrix to create a 3D embedding of my interests that preserves distances as best as possible (using MDS, multidimensional scaling). 3) Interpret the 3D embedding as locations within a 3D color space in which Euclidean distance corresponds to perceptual similarity. I chose the CIELAB color space.</p> <figure> <img width="300" src="/assets/images/interests/2d.png" alt="2D embedding of similarity matrix" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/> <figcaption style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5em;">You can get a sense of the process here.

I initiated this redesign of the Kording Lab under the philosophy that all things in life should be chosen by design, including the workplace. The "us", "we", etc., refer to the pre-pandemic Kording Lab circa 2019. Many of these voting-based practices continued through the pandemic and well after I graduated from the lab mid-2022.</p> <p><strong>Every lab is a set of practices, traditions, recurring events, and expectations.</strong> These practices determine the daily rhythms of its members. They affect personal growth, research quality, the relationships between its members, and how enjoyable it is to be a scientist. Unfortunately, for reasons relating to complacency and authority, I’ve found that a lot of labs just organize themselves in standard ways and don’t regularly switch things up.</p> <p>Just picture that “toxic” lab down the hall. (You know the one). Communication is stifled, trainees don’t feel nurtured, science is competitive, and everyone is scared of being wrong. These are some common big failures, but even the best labs have room to improve.</p> <p>Now, group leaders have the best of intentions. It’s just hard to be a perfect manager – too much is expected of advisors to be perfect at everything. For us, it was important to realize that we only had to <em>try to improve things</em> and things would improve just by virtue of our trying. It was the process of lab-improvement that matters, not just the new solutions. A good lab isn’t good from the outset, but rather has a process of reflection and regularly asks, <em>“How is this, what we’re doing now? Does it support our values? How could it be better?”</em></p> <p>This fall we challenged ourselves to make the Kording lab better suited for us. Our key realization was that we could <em>design our lab</em> towards the values we think make a good lab. Behavior follows structure!</p> <p>We changed a lot, and learned a lot, and we hope our lessons can be of some use to others.</p> <h5 id="overall-approach">Overall approach</h5> <p>We took a look at the way we run our lab in the same way that a human-centered design consultant would. Essentially this just means we separated the overall process into three separate steps. These occurred in three separate all-lab meetings.</p> <figure><center> <img width="500" src="/assets/images/lab_redesign/overall_schem-01.png" data-action="zoom"/> </center></figure> <p>We came up with over <strong>100</strong> ideas for good things our lab could do. We settled on implementing just one new thing each week. We’ve put in place some awesome things! (Scroll to the bottom if you just want to see what our new practices are.)</p> <p>At all times it was <strong>democratic</strong>: everyone had equal input. I can’t understate the importance of this. Since we were looking for a <strong>system that works for everyone</strong>, it was really helpful to hear from everyone what matters most to each of us. Everyone equally stated their priorities, came up with solutions, and decided what would be best for everyone. At our lab meeting each Wednesday, we now vote on one new thing to implement in our lab structure. What we ended up with is an environment where (I think!) everyone in the lab really feels empowered to contribute in their own way.</p> <h6 id="where-we-got-our-process-from">Where we got our process from</h6> <p>Very creative and smart folks in <strong>human-centered design</strong> have come up with ways of being creative about creativity. Many of the same folks have also thought a lot about what makes a great team and a great working environment. If you’re interested in learning more, I recommend checking out the courses put out by <a href="https://www.ideou.com/">IDEO</a>. I can vouch that these courses are entirely worth it. (I personally took the course entitled ‘Cultivating Creative Collaboration’).</p> <h6 id="how-konrad-got-involved">How Konrad got involved</h6> <p>We were really lucky to have an advisor with an open mind to new possibilities. The entire process was led by labmembers, and Konrad even stepped out at various points in the process when he felt his presence would stifle suggestions, conversation, or disagreement. It ended up being really useful that everyone in the lab felt so empowered, even new members and rotating students. Our process won’t work for all labs, I’m sure, but usually the reason trainees won’t speak up or act to improve their situation is that they feel intimidated by their advisor.</p> <p>Here’s what the process looked like at each stage.</p> <h3 id="stage-1-what-makes-a-good-lab-environment">Stage 1. What makes a good lab environment?</h3> <figure><center> <img width="500" src="/assets/images/lab_redesign/stage1_callout-01.png" data-action="zoom"/> </center></figure> <p><strong>Our lab practices were established long before anyone (besides Konrad) had arrived.</strong> In our first session, we spent some time just outlining what those things were. We don’t have weekly lab meetings, unlike a lot of labs. Instead, we largely met spontaneously and individually about our research. We also had weekly “lab teachings” in which one lab member would teach everyone about some concept they found interesting. We ended up keeping most of these practices (<em>free coffee!</em>) but it was helpful to recommit.</p> <p>We then outlined some of our goals in an open discussion. What should a lab be? How should people feel while a part of it? One of us stood at the whiteboard and put down what people said. You can see some of our priorities above.</p> <p>Out of the values that came out of that discussion, I want to single out the concept of <em>“psychological safety”</em>. (You can Google that one and jump right into the management consulting world.) Any manager (or PI) should strive for this. When an environment promotes psychological safety, it promotes:</p> <ol> <li>A learning mindset (in which it is OK to make mistakes),</li> <li>A curious mindset (in which people are curious of everyone’s thoughts.</li> <li>A vulnerable mindset (in which people feel welcomed to express their shortcomings).</li> </ol> <p>Once everyone had their say, the next step was to actually design towards what we just established as our collective goals. The central idea here is that behavior doesn’t just come about spontaneously. Recurring practices (like lab meetings) are essential. But what should they be?</p> <h3 id="stage-2-how-might-we-design-our-lab-environment">Stage 2: How might we design our lab environment?</h3> <figure><center> <img width="500" src="/assets/images/lab_redesign/converge-diverge-01.png" data-action="zoom"/> </center></figure> <h4 id="diverging--brainstorming">Diverging &amp; Brainstorming</h4> <p>“Coming up with ideas” sounds organic, but it’s helpful to be systematic about it. We had two phases: <strong>1) Diverging</strong> and <strong>2) Converging</strong>. In the “diverging” stage, the goal was to come up with as many and as diverse ideas as possible. We saved any critical thought (“that won’t work because…”) until the “converging” phase. By brainstorming ideas without critiquing them at the same time, you can encourage creativity and diversity. People feel encouraged to try things out without risk of being shut down. This process also avoids the failure mode of running with the first good idea; the best ideas usually come later.</p> <p><strong>We spent 5 minutes in silence writing ideas onto post-its.</strong> I highly recommend the post-it approach as opposed to hand-raising or open discussion. Our best ideas came out from that silence. It’s efficient and gets ideas equally from everyone. IDEO folks will also tell you that post-its allow the idea’s originator to detach themself from their own ideas.</p> <p>After a few rounds of post-its and idea presentations, we had over 100 ideas of awesome-sounding lab practices.</p> <h4 id="converging">Converging</h4> <p>We wanted to ensure that the process was democratic throughout. (This is all about creating a lab environment that everyone feels they own, after all.) Since voting on 100 things is a lot, we took another trick from IDEO’s book and <em>voted in parallel</em>. Everyone had several votes in each of several categories, and in a mad dash we voted on everything and then dropped the half of ideas with the least votes.</p> <figure><center> <sup>Our shared google sheet for voting on ideas.</sup> <img width="700" src="/assets/images/lab_redesign/voting.png" data-action="zoom"/> </center></figure> <h3 id="stage-3-a-continued-process-of-weekly-voting">Stage 3: A continued process of weekly voting.</h3> <p>Instead of deciding right away what the full list of new practices will be, we took it slow and chose things one at a time, once per week. We did this weekly all through the fall. In the first 10 minutes of lab meetings (or rather, lab teachings), we nominate a few possibilities from the list. Everyone votes for their favorite, and the option with the most votes takes it. Then – ta da! – we have a new lab practice.</p> <h5 id="every-new-practice-has-a-czar">Every new practice has a czar</h5> <p>When we decide on a new practice, we also nominate a person to be in charge of bringing it into being and ensuring it continues to happen. We found this to be enormously helpful. The czars rotate once a semester so people don’t get burned out.</p> <h3 id="5-overall-takeaways">5. Overall takeaways</h3> <p>More than anything else, I’d say the democratic aspect of this process helped the most. A lot of standard practices – and things we already did – actually work quite well. The problem is that when they don’t have 100% buy-in, these practices tend to grow less helpful. Now everyone feels like they’ve <em>decided</em> to be doing them, we’ve really amped up our collective effort.</p> <p>It’s been fun to be creative with this. I’m proud of some of the changes we made. We’re more social as a lab, more supportive, and I think the high morale is going to be self-sustaining.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="our-current-list-of-practices">Our current list of practices</h3> <p>Our practices generally fall into the categories of <em>physical environment, scheduling, orientation, social, research communication, mentorship, documentation, and resources.</em></p> <ol> <li><strong>Lab teachings</strong>: A member of the lab leads a ~1 hour ‘teaching’ on a subject of their interest. It cannot be updates on their current research. This is a longstanding Kording lab practice. http://kordinglab.com/2018/08/29/upcoming-lab-teaching.html</li> <li><strong>1-on-1’s</strong>: Every member of the lab is required to sit down with every other member of the lab and discuss their work for an hour. Refreshes once a semester.</li> <li><strong>Physical environment</strong>: We now have <ul> <li>little magnetic pandas that are used to indicate if you would like not to be bothered (see pic)</li> <li>yoga mats</li> <li>a hammock <img width="200" style="float: right" src="/assets/images/lab_redesign/pandas/20191122_182635.jpg" data-action="zoom"/></li> <li>a hangboard</li> <li>plants</li> <li>a tea kettle</li> <li>an espresso machine and free coffee</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Tea talks</strong>: The tea czar makes tea, and someone gives a 10 minute talk about anything. Usually someone talks about an idea they’re working on in their research. This happens weekly.</li> <li><strong>Monday morning donuts</strong>: Our lab is not an early-morning lab. Some of us need a push out of bed. For that reason we have donuts in the lab served at 9:00am every Monday.</li> <li><strong>A potluck lunch</strong>: Once a semester, we have a potluck.</li> <li><strong>DJ Friday</strong>: We just play music in the lab on Friday afternoons! We have a shared lab YouTube playlist, and anyone can add to it.</li> <li><strong>Failure Friday</strong>: Academia is full of times of disappointment, big and small. To bring these events into the open, we have a Failure Friday every now and then in which people are encouraged to discussed things that did not go as hoped, what they learned, and (if asked for) for advice going forward.</li> <li><strong>‘Extreme’ (pair) programming</strong>: All about learning to code! Everyone is matched with someone else, and the two of them code together. One codes, the other watches, and then they switch.</li> <li><strong>Lab calendar</strong>: A simple Google Calendar that everyone can edit. For these lab practices but also for seminars and so on.</li> <li><strong>Web redesign efforts</strong>: These are more one-off things. If we vote on a specific web improvement, then we appoint a czar and they are in charge of coordinating the lab to get this done. Often these are resources we want, like how-to’s.</li> </ol> <p>That’s the list! There are still things to be voted on, too – it’s an ongoing process. An orientation buddy system and more social events are likely upcoming additions.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="lab culture"/><category term="metascience"/><category term="lab management"/><category term="human-centered design"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 'design process' works really well for creating a good lab culture.]]></summary></entry></feed>
