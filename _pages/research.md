### Theoretical neuroscience: Neuromodulation and Cellular Diversity

Much of my ongoing research is about building a connectionist framework for understanding neuromodulation. I am also interested in the roles of cell types in neural circuits.

### Machine learning for single-cell data analysis

I am currently developing machine learning methods to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data, focusing on how cellular diversity influences neural circuit function.

Stay tuned!

## Past work

### Bio-inspired materials science and molecular dynamics

Before I transitioned to neuroscience, I worked on bio-inspired materials science and molecular dynamics simulations. I was interested in self-assembly and how molecular interactions can lead to complex structures. The common thread that connected these interests was looking at nature in terms of its function, as might an engineer, as well as an interest in complex systems.
