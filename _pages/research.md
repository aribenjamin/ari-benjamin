## Past work

### Bio-inspired materials science and molecular dynamics

Before I transitioned to neuroscience, I worked on bio-inspired materials science and molecular dynamics simulations. I was interested in self-assembly and how molecular interactions can lead to complex structures. The common thread that connected these interests was looking at nature in terms of its function, as might an engineer, as well as an interest in complex systems.
