I am a pattern of neural activity which is often interested and curious about its own activity, and the activity of other brains.

Programmatically, I am a neuroscientist and AI researcher. My work falls in categories at various levels of abstraction about the brain, from neural network theory to the analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data. I believe in the necessity of mathematical models but also that all neuroscience needs to directly connect to the biology of the brain. 

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Tony Zador at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Before this I completed my PhD with Konrad Kording at the University of Pennsylvania.
